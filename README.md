# OpenPair: Golang Intro 03

![Cover Image](./cover.png)

Welcome to `GoLang Intro 03`! This part of the series dives deeper into GoLang, exploring advanced concepts like interfaces, enhanced error handling, and concurrency, along with a focus on testing these features. Below you'll find an overview of the main code and its corresponding test file.

## Main Code (main.go)

The `main.go` file demonstrates several advanced GoLang concepts:

- **Structs and Methods**: Introduction to structs with added fields and methods. We use an `Animal` struct as an example.
- **Interfaces**: Illustration of how interfaces work in GoLang. We define a `Mover` interface and show how `Animal` implements this interface.
- **Concurrency**: An enhanced concurrency example using goroutines, channels, and the `select` statement.
- **Error Handling**: Demonstrating Go's approach to error handling with an enhanced divide function that includes error checking.

## Test Code (main_test.go)

The `main_test.go` file contains tests for the `main.go` file:

- **TestSpeak**: Testing the `Speak` method of the `Animal` struct. It checks whether the animals return the correct sounds.
- **TestMove**: Testing the `Move` method to verify if the `Animal` struct correctly implements the `Mover` interface.

## Running the Code

To run the main program, use:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Running the Tests

To execute the tests, navigate to the directory containing your Go files and run:

```bash
go test
```

This command will run all the tests in your package. To run specific tests, use `go test -run TestName`, replacing `TestName` with the name of the test function.
