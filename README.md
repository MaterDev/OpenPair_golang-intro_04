# OpenPair: Golang Intro 04

![Cover Image](./cover.png)

Welcome to `GoLang Intro 04`! In this session of our series, we further explore GoLang, with a special focus on concurrency, pointers, and interfaces. These concepts are demonstrated through a series of examples in our `main.go` file. You can also find the corresponding study session recorded on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2NvA4OAtDRS2wBL2FvjiSlKCtcBrcFzc).

## Main Code (main.go)

The `main.go` file in this session covers:

- **Concurrency**: Demonstrating Go's concurrency model using goroutines, channels, and the `select` statement. The examples range from basic synchronization of goroutines to more advanced patterns involving multiple channel communications.
- **Pointers**: Introduction to pointers in Go, illustrating how they can be used to modify values and to implement methods with pointer receivers in structs.
- **Interfaces**: Showcasing how interfaces are defined and implemented in Go. The examples include simple interfaces as well as more advanced uses demonstrating polymorphism.

## Running the Code

To run the main program, execute the following in your terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```
